Concepts I gained a deeper understanding of include:
nested loops and how to use them
functions and how to use functions
difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
a prototype
scope of variables
gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra

a function that multiplies two integers
a function that prints the numbers 0-9
a function that prints the numbers 0-9 and skips 2 and 4
a function that prints 10 times the numbers 0-14
a function that draws a straight line in the terminal, print "_" n times
a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal, print "\" n times
a function that prints a square, using #
a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers which are multiples of both three and five
a function that prints a triangle with # based on size argument
a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143
a function that prints an integer
